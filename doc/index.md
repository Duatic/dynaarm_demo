# DynaArm Demo

The examples are split into two basic types:

## 1. [Single arm setup](../dynaarm_single_example/dynaarm_single_example.md)

This example shows how to integrate a single DynaArm into your own application. It demonstrates the following points:

1. Integration of the xacro model into your own environment
2. Configure the arm and start it with real/mock/simulated hardware
3. Integrate and operate the arm with MoveIt2

## 2. [Dual arm setup](../dynaarm_dual_example/dynaarm_dual_example.md)

This examples shows all points from the single arm setup but with an additional arm added. This setup can also be used as a base for a multiarm setup (more than 2 arms).

Multiple arms are general more difficult to handle. This example does not cover the whole integration of a multiarm setup into MoveIt.
